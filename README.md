# Image-Recognition-and-Classification-using-CIFAR-10-dataset
The idea of the project was to predict different images of CIFAR-10 dataset accurately. Used Resnet-18 as feature extractor and compared the performance of finetuning (accuracy ~85%) and extracted features (accuracy ~60%) to predict the top predictions for each class
